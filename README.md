<h1>Grapple Game</h1>
<h3>Overview</h3>
This is a first-person platformer game consisting of two levels: a tutorial and a test level. The tutorial introduces the player to the controls, including movement (W-A-S-D), jumping (space bar), and using a grappling hook (E). The grappling hook allows the player to swing, grab objects, and push buttons. Interactive elements include levitating platforms, pressure plates, and grabbable cubes. Menus are available to select levels, adjust settings, and return to the main menu. The player can access the in-game menu with ESC, offering options to resume, adjust mouse sensitivity, or quit. Upon completing the second level, a congratulatory message is shown.
